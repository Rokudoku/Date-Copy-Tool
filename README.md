# Date-Copy-Tool
My first real project. I use python and the tkinter module for a GUI.

The aim of this project is to create an application that can copy dates (such as today's or yesterday's date) to clipboard at
the press of a button or keypress so that it can quickly be pasted.

My dad requested this project so a running executable is also required and since there are distinct differences in a tkinter 
GUI for windows and OSX, there should be both versions.
