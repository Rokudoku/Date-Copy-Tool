# Date-Copy-Tool
My first real personal project.

Python and tkinter were used to create a GUI application that can quickly copy yesterday's, today's and tomorrow's date to clipboard at the press of a button or keypress so that it may be pasted elsewhere.

cx_Freeze was used to package the tool into an executable along with the files so that Python and tcl(for tkinter) do not have to be installed on the running computer. (This is only available for Windows at the moment).

The dates are in the format of \<day\> \<abbreviated month\> \<year\> (e.g. 25 Jan 2017).

Trailing and leading spaces can be added in options. The button size can also be changed.

### Instructions for executable
    - Download and unzip Date_Copy_Tool.zip
    - Within the folder, run date_copy_tool.exe
